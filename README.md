# Mike West's Portfolio
I'm Mike West and this is my portfolio. 

## About me
I have been a software developer for over 20 years. You name it, Assembly Language, C/C++, Forth, Java, Perl, PL/1, Python the list goes on. One thing I've learned is that you can't rest on the past. Software development changes rapidly and I've changed with it. That's why this portfolio, from my
UCI Full Stack Developers Boot Camp exists. To demonstrate some of my work in HTML5, Javascript, CSS and Node.
